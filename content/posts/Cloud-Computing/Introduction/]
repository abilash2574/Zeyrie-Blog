# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is defined as storing and accessing data, and computing services through internet. To be more clear, we can use the resources for our business, project or IT, without actually having to built and manage the hardware, by using the cloud computing services provided by any third party company that is located anywhere in the world through internet. A more broad view of cloud computing is to deliver the computational resources to us from a location other than the one from which we are computing.

  The concept of cloud computing becomes more understandable when one begins to think what modern IT environments always require - the means to increase capacity or add capabilities to their infrastructure dynamically, without investing money in the purchase of new infrastructure, all the while without needing to conduct training for new personnel and without the need for licensing new software. We only have to use the service and pay for what we use.
