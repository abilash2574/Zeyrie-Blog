## What is Cloud Computing?
{{< style "text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px;" >}}

Cloud computing is defined as storing and accessing data, and computing services through internet. To be more clear, we can use the resources for our business, project or IT, without actually having to built and manage the hardware, by using the cloud computing services provided by any third party company that is located anywhere in the world through internet. A more broad view of cloud computing is to deliver the computational resources to us from a location other than the one from which we are computing.

The concept of cloud computing becomes more understandable when one begins to think what modern IT environments always require - the means to increase capacity or add capabilities to their infrastructure dynamically, without investing money in the purchase of new infrastructure, all the while without needing to conduct training for new personnel and without the need for licensing new software. We only have to use the service and pay for what we use.

### Different Computing paradigms

#### Distributed Computing

{{< style "text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px;" >}}

At first there was the centralized computing method where a mainframe computer is connected to different sub terminals. There terminals are used to do tasks, which will be processed by the mainframe computer. With this method there were so many limitations and disadvantages that lead to the evolution of Distributed Computing.

{{< style "text-align: justify; " >}}

**Distributed Computing** came along with the concept of networking, where it is defined as a network of autonomous computers that have their own local memory and processor, these computer communicate to each other to perform a single task or to solve a bunch of threads of a single process.

#### Grid Computing
{{< style "text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px;" >}}

{{< admonition quote "IBM's definition:" false>}}

Grid computing enables the virtualization of distributed computing and data resources such as processing, network bandwidth and storage capacity to create a single system image, granting users and applications seamless access to vast IT capabilities. Just as an Internet user views a unified instance of content via the Web, a grid user essentially sees a single, large virtual computer.

{{< style "text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px;" >}}

To explain in simple terms, its a form of networking, unlike conventional networks that focus on communication among devices, grid computing harnesses unused processing cycles of all computers in a network for solving problems too intensive for any stand-alone machine.

The users gain access to grid computing resources (processors, storage, data, applications, and so on) as needed with little or no knowledge of where those resources are located or what the underlying technologies, hardware, operating sytems are. **The Grid** links together computing resources and provides the mechanism needed to access them to the users.

#### Cluster Computing

{{< style "text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px;" >}}

A cluster is a type of parallel or distributed computer system, which consists of a collection of inter-connected stand-alone computers working together as a single integrated computing resource. Key components of a cluster include multiple standalone computers, operating systems, high-performance interconnects, middleware, parallel programming environments, and applications.

#### Utility Computing

{{< style "text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px;" >}}

Utility Computing is a service provisioning model in which a service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to the customer as needed, and charges them for specific usage rather than a flat rate. This model has the advantage of a low or no initial cost to acquire computer resources; instead, computational resources are essentially rented.

<br>
{{< style "text-align: justify; " >}}
These can be computing services that are rented to users to use as per their needs and users pay as they consume the resource. Some typical similarities of this type of computing services can be power consumtions, mobile and internet services, as we pay for these services as we consume the resource

## Cloud Computing

{{< style "text-align: justify; em {color: #FF7777;}" >}}

{{< admonition quote "US NIST defines:" >}}

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of _configurable computing resources_ (e.g networks, servers, storage, applications, and servers) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or provider interaction.

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

###### On-demand self-service

A cloud computing service are availabel on-demand and does not require much human interactive administators. The consumer himself can provision, manage, and monitor the resources as per his requirement.

###### Broad network access

Cloud computing is accessible from a network, generally over the internet, and can be accessed by a diverse customer platforms which are hetrogeneous. Similarly, private cloud servics can be accessed anywhere within the enterprise. The Network bandwidth and latency are very important aspects of cloud computing because they relate to the Quality of Service(QoS) of the network.

###### Resource Pooling

The providers computing resources such as servers, processors, storage, applicatoins, and services are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically addigned and reassigned as per the consumer need.

###### Measured Service

{{< style "text-align: justify; " >}}

Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resources use by leveraging a metering capabilities at some level of abstraction to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). The utilization of resources is tracked, controlled and reported for each occupant. This gives transparency to both the service provider and the consumer. The cloud system has a metering capability, which is leveraged to monitor billing, use of resources, and pay only for what has been used.

###### Rapid Elasticity

{{< style "text-align: justify; " >}}

Resource capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to meet immediate requirements. Similarly, they can be removed or scaled down as per the need. In many cases, these can happen automatically in response to the business demands. This makes sure that the application has the capacity it needs at any point in time. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appears to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quality at any time.

The scalability adds a cost-effectiveness aspect to the cloud technology. When the demand or workload is high, more servers can be added for that particular period.
