## What is Cloud Computing?
{{< style "text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px;" >}}

Cloud computing is defined as storing and accessing data, and computing services through internet. To be more clear, we can use the resources for our business, project or IT, without actually having to built and manage the hardware, by using the cloud computing services provided by any third party company that is located anywhere in the world through internet. A more broad view of cloud computing is to deliver the computational resources to us from a location other than the one from which we are computing.

The concept of cloud computing becomes more understandable when one begins to think what modern IT environments always require - the means to increase capacity or add capabilities to their infrastructure dynamically, without investing money in the purchase of new infrastructure, all the while without needing to conduct training for new personnel and without the need for licensing new software. We only have to use the service and pay for what we use.

### Different Computing paradigms

#### Distributed Computing

{{< style "text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px;" >}}

At first there was the centralized computing method where a mainframe computer is connected to different sub terminals. There terminals are used to do tasks, which will be processed by the mainframe computer. With this method there were so many limitations and disadvantages that lead to the evolution of Distributed Computing.

**Distributed Computing** came along with the concept of networking, where it is defined as a network of autonomous computers that have their own local memory and processor, these computer communicate to each other to perform a single task or to solve a bunch of threads of a single process.

  - Internet
  - ATM and bank machines
  - Intranets/Workgroups

#### Grid Computing

{{< admonition quote "IBM's definition:" false>}}

Grid computing enables the virtualization of distributed computing and data resources such as processing, network bandwidth and storage capacity to create a single system image, granting users and applications seamless access to vast IT capabilities. Just as an Internet user views a unified instance of content via the Web, a grid user essentially sees a single, large virtual computer.

To explain in simple terms, its a form of networking, unlike conventional networks that focus on communication among devices, grid computing harnesses unused processing cycles of all computers in a network for solving problems too intensive for any stand-alone machine.

The users gain access to grid computing resources (processors, storage, data, applications, and so on) as needed with little or no knowledge of where those resources are located or what the underlying technologies, hardware, operating sytems are. **The Grid** links together computing resources and provides the mechanism needed to access them to the users.

#### Utility Computing

#### Cloud Computing

### Grid Computing or Cloud Computing?

Grid computing is often confused with cloud computing. Grid computing is a form of distributed computing that implements a virtual supercomputer made up of a cluster of networked or Internetworked computers acting in unison to perform very large tasks. But cloud computing should be seen as an evolved
